# Still to do

* Let group members know about issue with heroku load times.  Set up 
web monitoring service that will ping sites at regular intervals.

* Get rid of cron job for water pump.  Water pump is now used by listening
for changes to firebase.

* Figure out what should be displayed on the page after the raspi
is no longer functional.

* Set up actual plant

* Presentation

* Documentation


# Change login and sign up on nav to My Account when user is logged in

# Responsiveness issues on Welcome page.  Auth-inner has static width
* Could be fixed with reduced padding on smaller sizes (bootstrap classes)
and setting the width to 70%
    - Padding on mobile set to 20px 10px 30px for auth-inner fixes the issues

# Binding in login and signup pages
* Don't need to bind in constructor when using arrow functions for methods.

# Nothing happens if I login with a non-existent username
